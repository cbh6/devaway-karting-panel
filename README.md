## What?:

- I have done this small project as a technical test for [Devaway](https://devaway.io/) company
- The test is about implementing a front-end application to display the Karting World Championship
- A JSON is provided and I had to structure the data in order to display the global ranking, races info and driver details
- A TV Mode is also available on the application, where we can see all the pages in rotation.

## How? / Tech üì¶:

- React (Create React App)
- SCSS and BEM for styling
- Jest + react-testing-library for testing

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
